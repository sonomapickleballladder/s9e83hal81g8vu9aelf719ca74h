<h3 class="under" id="step1">Step 1:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Find the email sent to you from SPLinfo@riseup.net, with the&nbsp;Subject line: <em>'Pickleball Ladder: Your Calendar LINK'</em></p></li>
<li><p>(Note: depending on when you are reading this, you may not have received this email yet. If you haven't received it by 09/02/2022 though, please <a href="mailto:SPLinfo@riseup.net?subject=Have%20not%20received%20Calendar%20Link%20yet">email the Ladder Administrator</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="under" id="step2">Step 2:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><mark>Using a computer rather than a phone if possible</mark></strong>, <em>open the LINK in the email to access your unique Availability Calendar</em>. It should have your name showing at the top left.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="under" id="step3">Step 3:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="mrk">Click and drag anywhere in the calendar to create</code> <strong><mark><em>2hr minimum</em></mark></strong> <code class="mrk">blocks of time that indicate when you are available in the coming week</code>.&nbsp;<strong><mark>(Make sure you are working with the correct week)</mark></strong></p></li>
<li><p><code class="mrk">Add your <mark>first name</mark> in the Title field of each block you create.</code> (See screenshot below for reference).</p></li>
<li><p>If you can only play at certain locations for any particular time-block, <code class="mrk">specify that in the Location field</code>. Example: "Finley, Howarth, RP". (See screenshot below for reference). If this is left blank, it is assumed that you are flexible and can play anywhere at that time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="add.jpg" alt="Unable to load image"></img></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code class="mrk">Please include a block for the default time of</code> <strong><mark>Sunday 12:00 - 2:00 PM</mark></strong> <code class="mrk">if you can make that</code>. This is when you need to be available in order to be guaranteed participation in the ladder that week.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="mrk">Regardless of whether you can make the default time or not,</code> <strong><mark>PLEASE MARK ALL THE OTHER TIMES YOU CAN PLAY!</mark></strong> <code class="mrk">This gives players who cannot make the default time that week a shot at still being able to play. It also makes it much less likely that a majority of groups end up using the default time and that your group is unable to get a court.</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="under">How it works:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The Ladder Administrator will view your Calendar alongside the other participants' Calendars to determine overlapping time windows, and will post the <a href="groups.html">groups</a> and notify you (by email) as soon as they are posted <strong>every Monday</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Group <code class="mrk">playing times and locations</code> will be posted on the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cryptpad.fr/calendar/#/2/calendar/view/4osEwhLxsAQ7wCQ26Hy2UbkcGfVLU38DL8PXCgmlt20/">Groups Calendar</a>. However, if all 4 players in a group communicate and agree to it, they may choose to play at a different time or location to the one provided.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="descrip">Here (below) are a few examples of what your finished Calendar might look like each week, as well as what likelihood each example would give you of being able to play.</p>

<h3 class="under">Guaranteed:</h3>
<img src="screenshot2.jpg" alt="Unable to load image"></img>
<p>This player would be guaranteed to play as they are available at the default time (circled in red). They are also helping other players have a better shot at being able to play by offering numerous other time windows.</p>

<h3 class="under">Likely</h3>
<img src="good.jpg" alt="Unable to load image">
<p>The default window is not included, but plenty of other large time windows are provided. If all 4 players in a potential group provide a similar number of similarly sized time windows each week, the chances of there not being any overlapping 2 hour windows would be slim.</p>

<h3 class="under">Very Unlikely:</h3>
<img src="bad.jpg" alt="Unable to load image">
<p>The default window is not included, and only 4 time windows are offered, 2 of them being only 2 hours long (circled). Chances of there being any overlapping 2 hour windows are low.</p>

<h3 class="under" id="note">Note:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><mark>Any time-blocks you create which are shorter than 2 hours in length will be ignored</mark></strong>, as will <strong>any portion of a time-block</strong> which lies between 9:00 PM and 7:00 AM. [Be aware of sunset times if not playing at a floodlit venue!]</p></li>
<li><p>All available times you wish to offer <strong><mark>must be added before 9:00 PM every Sunday</mark></strong> in order to be considered.</p></li>
<li><p>Please <a href="mailto:SPLinfo@riseup.net">email SPLinfo@riseup.net</a> if you have any questions about or problems with your Calendar.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="under" id="aspecialnoteaboutschedulingnbsp">A Special Note About Scheduling:</h3>
<p>Ladder play does not have to happen at off-peak hours. You are perfectly entitled to play your Ladder matches between 9am-12pm at the public courts—i.e. during what is considered "peak time"— when there are cooler temperatures, and less wind. So by all means offer morning times in the scheduling process.</p>
<p>At any time, if all courts are full, please note that you must be willing to rotate off between games. And then you can rotate back on (probably within just a few minutes) to the next available court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, the City of Santa Rosa policy is that&nbsp;"The courts are open for all to play on during peak hours…&nbsp;the courts must be shared, but it does not dictate who or how people play. [Players] must rotate off the court after one game but can rotate back in as a group&nbsp;… &nbsp;[The policy] acknowledges that not everyone wants to rotate in with people they do not know or people at another level of play."</p>
<p>Court capacity at Finley, especially during weekday mornings, is now substantially increased with the addition of 6 more cross-lined courts with high-quality nets available for use.</p>
