  <p>Welcome to the Sonoma Pickleball Ladder, a new initiative to offer
  competitive play for the many players seeking it.</p>

For anyone new to the Ladder concept:
<ul>
  <li>Ladder play is all about offering well-matched games to
  similarly-skilled players.</li>
  <li>Everyone moves up or down in the ladder rankings based on their
  results, and sooner or later, everyone finds their most appropriate place
  (in theory at least!) in the ladder, leading to well-balanced matches.</li>

</ul>


  <p>I ran a pilot, beta phase of the ladder during the summer, and am now ready
  to launch the real version offering it to everyone.</p>


  <p>To work well, it depends on scheduling, for which I have devised a
  Calendaring system. In the beta phase, using this enabled twice as many
  players to play each week as were able to with just the default time.
  Please bring your best intentions and trust in the process, and have fun!</p>


  <p>Please note, I am charging what I hope is a manageable fee for
  participation. Itâ€™s to cover the considerable time it takes to set up
  players for participation, and to schedule overlapping times for groups
  each week.</p>
