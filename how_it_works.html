<p>Ladder play does not have to happen at off-peak hours. You are perfectly entitled to play your Ladder matches between 9am-12pm at the public courts—i.e. during what is considered "peak time"— when there are cooler temperatures, and less wind. So by all means offer morning times in the scheduling process.</p>

<p>At any time, if all courts are full, please note that you must be willing to rotate off between games. And then you can rotate back on (probably within just a few minutes) to the next available court.</p>

<p>Further, the City of Santa Rosa policy is that "The courts are open for all to play on during peak hours... the courts must be shared, but it does not dictate who or how people play. [Players] must rotate off the court after one game but can rotate back in as a group ...  [The policy] acknowledges that not everyone wants to rotate in with people they do not know or people at another level of play."</p>

<p>Court capacity at Finley, especially during weekday mornings, is now substantially increased with the addition of 6 more cross-lined courts with high-quality nets available for use.</div>

<h3 class="under"  id="Groupings">Groupings:</h3>
<ul>
<li class="hidden">Players will be grouped in groups of 4 at the start of each week. These are determined by rankings and availability. Group 1 will be comprised of the top 4 available players. Group 2 will be the next 4, and so on.</li>
<li><mark>Groupings can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="groups.html">Groups Page</a>. Look for them to be updated every Monday around noon unless you are notified otherwise</mark>.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="hidden">
<li><mark>As soon as the groups have been posted each week, you are welcome (and strongly encouraged) to contact the other players in your group (see <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/view/Dv1RB+iV-T5rPQi-d935ljZqUQINHa-P6-n+E7KoZi8/embed/">contact information page</a>) and arrange when and where to play</mark>.</li>

<h3 class="under" id="Unforseen-circumstances">Unforseen circumstances:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If one or more players in a group get sick, injured, or are otherwise unable to play due to exceptional circumstances, the remaining players can choose not to play that week (in which case their positions in the standings will be unaffected), or they may opt to bring in a sub (or multiple subs if necessary).</li>
<li>The sub should be at a similar level, but their scores will not count and they do not have to be signed up for the Ladder.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="under" id="Punctuality">Punctuality:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please don’t be late! Be conscious that others in your group have arranged their schedule to play at that specific time.
If you’re late, you may be significantly inconveniencing or frustrating them.
</li>
<li>To be fair to all the other players, unless it’s an emergency, or there are extenuating circumstances, the following penalties apply for
arriving late past the scheduled start time:<br>

<code class="thin"><p><b>15-30 mins late</b> :: your opponents get a 5 point headstart in every game to 15 (a 3 point headstart in every game to 11).</p></code>
<code class="thin"><p><b>30-45 mins late</b> :: your opponents get an 8 point headstart in every game to 15 (a 5 point headstart in every game to 11).</p></code>
<code class="thin"><p><b>45+ mins late</b> :: your opponents get an 11 point headstart in every game to 15 (a 7 point headstart in every game to 11).</p></code>
<code class="thin"><p><b>No Show</b> :: You will not be able to play the next week.</p></code>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="under"  id="Submitting-your-scores">Submitting your scores:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please keep track of your scores after each game finishes and make sure everyone in your group agrees with them at the end of play.</li>
<li><mark>It is every group's responsibility to submit their scores before the <a href="#weekend">end of each week</a>, as they are used to form the next week's rankings</mark>.</li>
<li>Failure to do so will result in all players in the group dropping two ranking spots, (the same as if they hadn't played).</li>
<li>Since nobody wants this to happen, it is a good practice to submit them the same day after playing.</li>
<li>To submit scores, please visit the <a target="_blank" href="scores.html">Submit Scores page</a>. You will have the choice to submit by email or enter them into the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/OGZF7TQ5hdgy2QwmVRqx1n-f/embed/">Scores Spreadsheet</a>.</li>
<li>Submitting by spreadsheet is preferable if you have access to a computer (it is not very usable on a phone). However, beware that it may take a minute to load and that you may need to press Cmd+S (Mac) or Ctrl+S (Windows/Linux) to save any changes you make if they do not appear to have saved automatically (which they should).</li>
<li>Please look at the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/OGZF7TQ5hdgy2QwmVRqx1n-f/embed/">Scores Spreadsheet</a> every Sunday if posssible to check that your group's scores appear correct. Once the next week starts, they may not be able to be changed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="under"  id="Moving-up-or-down">Moving up or down:</h3>
<ul>
<li>New rankings will be formed each week based on the previous week's results.</li>
<li>There are two operations which are performed to calculate the new rankings:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, the players who played that week are re-ranked based on their seed number and how they finished in their groups (see 'Players Playing Re-ranked' rows in the <a target="_blank" href="results.html">Results sheet</a>). <mark>You finish 1st(/4th) in your group by having the highest(/lowest) point differential (points won – points lost)</mark>. This table below shows how you move up (←) or down (→) according to different finishes.
<table>
  <tr>
<td class="head" ></td>
    <td  class="head" colspan="5">Seed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="head" rowspan="6">Finish</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
  <td class="head" ></td>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1st</td>
  <td class="move">← 1</td>
  <td class="move">← 2</td>
  <td class="move">← 3</td>
  <td class="move">← 4</td>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2nd</td>
  <td class="move">1 →</td>
  <td class="move"></td>
  <td class="move">← 1</td>
  <td class="move">← 2</td>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3rd</td>
  <td class="move">2 →</td>
  <td class="move">1 →</td>
  <td class="move"></td>
  <td class="move">← 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>4th</td>
  <td class="move">4 →</td>
  <td class="move">3 →</td>
  <td class="move">2 →</td>
  <td class="move">1 →</td>
</tr>
</table>
The logic behind the movement is that the 1st seed (highest ranked player) is expected to win the group and therefore only moves up 1 place for doing so. If the 1st seed gets last in the group however, they are losing the 3 lower ranked players and therefore should be dropped below all of them. The same concept applies for the other 3 seeds. This system allows for lots of movement when the rankings are inaccurate and less movement as the rankings start to become more accurate.</li>
<br>
<li>Any players who did not play that week are then inserted into the 'Players Playing Re-ranked' list so that they end up 2 places lower down then they were at the start of the week. For example, if the player ranked 13th in the Ladder Standings does not play one week, they will be the 15th ranked player the next week (unseating and bumping down whoever is currently in the 15th spot in the 'Players Playing Re-ranked' list).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Note: When you move up, you improve your position in the Standings (your ranking), but you will not necessarily find yourself in a higher group the next week, as groups are determined by a combination of rankings and availability.</li>
<li class="hidden">In theory, the winner of each group would become the fourth/lowest seed in the group above, while the loser would assume the highest position in the group below. The other two players would remain in the same group, though their seedings might change based on how they do relative to each other. However, this will not always be the case, if any higher ranked players are absent that week. </li>
</ul>
